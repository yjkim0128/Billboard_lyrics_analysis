This folder has a R implementation version of one of the side tasks (word frequency analysis).The project itself was entirely developed in Python, and this is not an official portion of the project. I personally implemented this code just to suggest an alternative / different language-based approach for one of the tasks achieved within the project.This R code reads lyrics data, computes average count of the given word per song over years, and visualizes the analysis result through an interactive graph."processed_lyrics.csv" has the lyrics data the implementation uses, and "interactive.R" is the R script of the code. "Interactive plot.Rproj" is the saved workspace for this implementation. This implementation uses "ggplot2," "poorly," and "dplyr" libraries.Python version of the code that does the same (which is the original version of this implementation) could be found in the "main_task.py" within the "mysite" directory.
