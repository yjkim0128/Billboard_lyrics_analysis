Taylor Swift|ronan|2012|I remember your bare feet, down the hallway. I remember your little laugh, racecars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs. I love You to the moon and back. I remember your blue eyes, lookin' into mine, like we had our own secret club. I remember you dancin', before bed time, then jumpin' on me wakin' me up. I can still feel you hold my hand, little man. And even the moment I knew, You fought it hard like an army guy. Rememeber I, leaned in and whispered to you Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here. You were my best four years. I remember the drive home, when the blind hope turned to cryin' and screamin' 'why'. Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died. And it's about to be Halloween, You could be anything You wanted, if You were still here. I remember the last day, when I kissed your face and whispered in your ear Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here. Out of this curtained room, and this hospital gray. We'll just disappear. Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here. You were my best four years. And what if I'm standin' in your closet, tryin' to talk to You. And what if I kept the handmedowns you won't grow into. And what if I really thought, some miracle would see us through. And what if the miracle was even getting one moment with You. Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here. Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here. You were my best four years. I remember your bare feet, down the hallway. I love You to the moon and back

Taylor Swift|state of grace|2012|I'm walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know is touch and go We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time And I never saw you coming And I'll never be the same You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannon ball Now all we know, is dont let go We are alone just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes So you were never a saint. And I love in shades of wrong We learn to live with the pain. Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild. And I never saw you coming And I'll never be the same This is a state of grace This is the worth while fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate Your'e my Achilles heel This is the golden age of something good And right and real And I never saw you coming And I'll never be the same And I never saw you coming And I'll never be the same This is a state of grace This is a worth while fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right
Taylor Swift|fifteen|2010|You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors It's the morning of your very first day You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while Try and stay out of everybody's way It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here For the next four years in this town Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say, "You know I haven't seen you around before." 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you You're gonna believe them And when you're fifteen Feeling like there's nothing to figure out Well count to ten, take it in This is life before you know who you're gonna be Fifteen You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail And soon enough you're best friends Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool We'll be out of here as soon as we can And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car And you're feeling like flying And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends When the night ends 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you You're gonna believe them When you're fifteen and your first kiss Makes your head spin round but In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team But I didn't know it at fifteen When all you wanted was to be wanted Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday But I realized some bigger dreams of mine And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy Who changed his mind and we both cried 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you You're gonna believe them And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall I've found that time can heal most anything And you just might find who you're supposed to be I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen La la la la la la la La la la la la la la La la la la la la la Your very first day Take a deep breath, girl Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

Taylor Swift|the moment i knew|2013|You should've been there, Should've burst through the door, With that 'baby I'm right here' smile, And it would've felt like, A million little shining stars had just aligned, And I would've been so happy. Christmas lights glisten, I've got my eye on the door, Just waiting for you to walk in, But the time is ticking, People ask me how I've been As I comb back through my memory, How you said you'd be here, You said you'd be here. And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With noone to impress, And they're all laughing, As I'm looking around the room, But there's one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. And the hours pass by, Now I just wanna be alone, But your close friends always seem to know When there's something really wrong, So they follow me down the hall, And there in the bathroom, I try not to fall apart, And the sinking feeling starts, As I say hopelessly, "He said he'd be here." And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With noone to impress, And they're all laughing, And asking me about you, But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. What do you say When tears are streaming down your face, In front of everyone you know? And what do you do when the one Who means the most to you, is the one who didn't show? You should've been here. And I would've been so happy. And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With noone to impress, And they're all standing around me singing, Happy Birthday to you, But there's one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. Ooh, I knew. You called me later, And said "I'm sorry I didn't make it" And I said "I'm sorry too" And that was the moment I knew.

Eminem|kings never die|2015|Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was Was it, too good to be true? Have nothin', get it all but too much of it Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens Cause if not, where the hell did it go? Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven Just choosing to sin Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again Do whatever I gotta do just to win Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head Crown around it, thorns on it Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya? How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bowout at I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a lovehate But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count Only time I ever been out and about Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin' I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone? Cause someone told me that Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer Wouldn't even take shit into consideration Obliterate anyone in the way I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blowout to get me to retire Tell these new artists that kings never die Did it just say I've been upstaged? Why am I online? It's driving me crazy I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform But as days pass in this shit And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous Comeback as if I went away But detractors just say so much for the Renegade Someone's gonna make me blow my composure Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage They so want a champion to fall It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all? So fuck what these cynics say just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office On the floor stacked against the door Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again? Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards And trophies just don't mean jack anymore If I'm here today and gone tomorrow And I'm not gonna be Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die I want it, I'm comin' to get it So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause They say kings never die Just ask Jam Master Jay They just grow wings and they fly So, hands up, reach for the sky Try to hold and prolong these moments Cause in a blink of an eye They'll be over Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were So before you're leavin' this Earth You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk Deacon of words, syllable genius at work Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness I went from powdered milk and Farina To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is It's that "Sound Bombing" Thirstin' Howl Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, outrhymin' everyone God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down I'ma be around foreverandaday, even in the ground You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die

We're gonna have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door And started whoopin' her ass worse than before They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! Feminist women love Eminem Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his youknowwhat Flippin' the youknowwho, yeah, but he's so cute though!" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss" And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They got the discovery channel don't they? "We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady All you other slim shadys are just imitating So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

I should download her audio on MP And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing but not quite me 'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady All you other slim shadys are just imitating So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

With his windows down and his system up So, will the real shady please stand up? And put one of those fingers on each hand up?

Eminem|normal|2018| Yo, how do I keep Getting in relationships like this? Maybe it says something about me Should I look in the mirror? I just want you to be normal Why can't you b**hes be normal? Always gotta be so extra Why you always need a lecture? My ex hates to talk, she's a texter Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her Wants to get back together Said not 'til she gets her act together She thinks I'm bein' mean and now She starts to scream and shout She's about to let the demons out She don't want to see me with other females out I tell the b**h to beat it, take the scenic route She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house In an evening gown with her cleavage out We've been down this road too many times for me to count And all I can think is how I just want you to be normal Why can't you b**hes be normal? Always gotta be so extra Like a f**in' terrestrial Guess it comes with the territory My ex girl, she just declared war Therefore, I better prepare for it I guess bein' weird's normal And I don't know what's got a hold of me Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted So much so that I bet you she don't know that she's The first thing I think of when I wake up And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless No wonder we're partners Both got hundreds of charges Domestic disputes but we've always Swept it under the carpet Even when gets the call that I slipped up and busted her jaw with A Louisville Slugger 'cause all's it Really does is make our love For each other grow stronger She won me over the second she tried to run me over Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over But why is she so wicked? And how the f** did I get so twisted? I'm with someone so unlikeable and shifty We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing She's only mine for the time being That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she Tried to twotime me And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave How could I be so naive? Should I leave or turn this entire evening Into a motherf**ing crime scene? Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him You weren't supposed to agree, you f**ing b**h! Especially when you're the one cheated first Now the argument immediately becomes heated You don't want me to flip, little conceded cunt Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it! I love you but I hope you f**in' die though In our business your friends like to pry so You've got 'em all under cover just like moles Hopin' they'll come back with intel But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral 'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone Who the f**'s Milo? The guy at work who drives a hilo I put a tracking device on your Chrysler And follow you while you drive home But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown You recognize me and had Milo flip me off Right out the pa**enger side window I hit a light pole, you skrt off And then pull up at am in the drive in a stretched white limo Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo But like a drunk bum, what do I know? Let's sleep on it like they did Revival I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole Just wanna be normal Why can't you be normal? I just wanna be normal Why can't you be normal?

Someone pinch me on the buns The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder I've had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her Then climb in, slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her Give her two compliments, backtoback, like "Tabatha, I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya" So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela 'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me And when we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me So if you call, I come, I will answer 'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep I hear my music box, playing a song for me So when she twirls around and do a whirl for me Won't you be my private little dancer?

Eminem|stepping stone|2018| Take you to the river Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah It's , everything was totally new We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue soldiers included A multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse We were so bulletproofwrote, souped and soaked in our youth Thought we was runnin' sh** 'til we lost the sole of our shoe The d**h of Doody broke us in two We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew How to stand on they own, and I don't want to open up wounds I just noticed that oomf was gone when we go in the booth 'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group If I could leave this world behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may End up runnin' back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones It was never the same, and it's bothered me since And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets The more time goes by, the more life happens And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities Plus we don't say how we feel And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in Been with you guys thick and thin But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends Which reminded me Biz, "Rockstar" was the sh** Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the sh** If you would've put D on it, wish I coulda did More than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is I think of all of the trips to BET And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features But that's water under the bridge But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed If I could leave this world behind I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line Turn to the river with you Help me leave this all behind I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may End up runnin' back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end One minute you're bodyin' sh**, but then your audience splits You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift To these kids you no longer exist Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this b**h To tiny drops, little drips And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift, all the carnage you left Is this the kind of karma you get For turnin' your f**in' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift? A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none I just wish I had words But I guess they're just honored for this To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you, man But I just can't be the guy everybody depends On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair I will always be here, but that spark isn't there And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air I'm barely chartin' myself Feels like I'm under the sink, but it was not my intent To treat y'all like a stepping stone Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live The less is left for closure, so let's let this go It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D is over I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may End up runnin' back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones
Eminem|good guy|2018| Here we go again from heroes to villains Used to be your Romeo, but we both were jilted A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with But still it gave me hope that we'll get Through it together, a severed earlobe Mailed to you in an ENVElope would be dope But what kind of lengths can you go? Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho To be a housewife who outright lies She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive I ran outside, why's she tryna act out? She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice Guys, when someone you'd die for Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more? Another late night in, she stumbles through my door Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers To plant the KY in; I'm gettin' accused by a whore Who smells like St. Ides and who's probably screwed five more Guys, s**ed eightnine men I'm takin' twobyfours to our eightbytens b**h it's you I tore out the frame, I win Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in And here's some twoply for when you date my friends In order to wipe your a** when you moved your bowels When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get? I'm waitin' for the day I can Hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him." Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in After you, I swore to make the gray skies end Here comes the rays like wind, you get a pay hike and Am I the good guy or do I just play like him And hope that he dumps you? It's like a dream come true, just to scream "f** you!" Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then 'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty They'll call me guilty You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty Even though you know the real me You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out But I let you say that you're the good guy 'Cause this ain't what love looks like You can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out But I let you say that you're the good guy They like, "You're the good guy." They like, they like, they like, "You're the good guy."

Eminem|guts over fear|2014|feat. Sia Produced By Emile Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same, old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped Started thinking my name was fault Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modernday Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I've went against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are When I was afraid to... I was a... Afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tiptoe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is here Guts over fear, I shall not tear For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear It's like I was there once, single parents Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world? And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck" Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in that trailer park? And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song But I'd rather make "Not Afraid " than make another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise, pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on And gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my dang self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shadymania, so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more From this day forward, just let them aholes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone And to think I was... gone

Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves We're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our sales You ignoramus but music is reflection of self We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin' To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry at night wishin' they die Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes That's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songs And we can Sing with me Sing for the year Sing for the laughter Sing for the tear Sing with me just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me Sing for the year Sing for the laughter Sing for the tear Sing with me just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Eminem|survival|2013|feat. Liz Rodrigues This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So take it all Wasn't ready to being a millionaire, I was illprepared I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end? It ain't over 'til I say it's over enough when I say enough Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivated it Weight is up, hands up like it's noon, nah, homie Hold them bitches straight up, up wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt I can see the finish line with each line that I finish I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what? They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust So floor's open if you'd like to discuss Top in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck To the side of a pump, to hop in and gun it Like GUnit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!

So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some toolboxes Cause you'll never take my pride from me It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buhlieve Cause this is something that I must use to succeed And if you don't like me then fuck you! Self esteem must be fucking shooting throughtheroof cause trust me My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me I can see why the fuck I disgust you I must be allergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it I just sneeze, I just go atchoo then achieve!

Let me explain just how to make greatness Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows If I press the issue just to get the anger out Full magazine could take Staples out Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account But b**h, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown Motherf**er, shut the f** up when I'm talkin', lil' b**h I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent?

Invite 'em in like a One A Day; I'm not done 'Cause I feel like the beast of burden That line in the sand, was it even worth it? 'Cause the way I see people turning's Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict Or still yet to be determined? 'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent Sold the dream to that he's deserted But I think it's workin' These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous And he's too scurred to answer me with words 'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered But I know at least he's heard it 'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists." But my beef is more media journalists I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist Can get a mouthful of flesh And yes, I mean eating a penis 'Cause they been pannin' my album to d**h So I been givin' the media fingers Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh But they been puttin' me through the wringer So I ain't ironin' sh** out with the press But I just took this beat to the cleaners

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time?

Eminem|headlights|2014|feat. Nate Ruess Mom, I know I let you down And though you say the days are happy Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up? And mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far? Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I don't hate you cause ma! You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb Equivalent to Chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But, agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me You're kicking me out? It's degrees and it's Christmas Eve ma, let me grab my fucking coat Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both We're in the same fucking boat You'd think that it'd make us close Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine A car full of belongings Still got a ways to go, back To grandma's House it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest So my shoulders carried the weight Of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at years old, and That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them And although one has met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one nights As we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you this message That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama... I want a new life, one without a cause So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down, and if the crew can't wake me up Just know that I was alright, and I was not afraid to die Even if there's songs to sing, my children will carry me Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my new girl, so I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die 
Eminem|rap god|2014|Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But I'm only going to get this one chance Something's wrong, I can feel it Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box They said I rap like a robot, so call me rapbot But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skillaholic This flippity dippityhippity hiphop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappityrap Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yapyap, yacketyyack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop Fbombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since MC's get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, Pac N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet RunD.M.C And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking? Little gaylookin boy So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy You're witnessing a massoccur Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy I'ma work for Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit Get outta my face, looking boy Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up With the same pace, looking boy Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting And I should not be woken I'm the walking dead But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating But I got your mom deep throating I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothing in common, poodle I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me My honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to Maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP When I tried to say "I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK, a revolver and a nine" See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm Morphin' into an immortal Coming through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from , though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking Cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singing to a man while they played piano Man, oh man, that was a special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!" Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed Uh, summalumma, doomalumma, you assuming I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music "Oh, he's too mainstream" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it "It's not hiphop, it's pop" Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it "I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too? Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades, these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues But it's still tongueincheek, fuck you I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel I'm asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz Still "Chunky but Funky" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic To the situation and understand the discrimination But fuck it Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip abroad And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard Be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a God?

Eminem|25 to life|2010|Too late for the other side Caught in a chase, to life Too late for the other side Caught in a chase, to life Too late Caught in a chase, to life I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid Down and died for you I no longer cry for you No more pain Bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart And ran it straight into the planet Into the dirt I can no longer stand it Now my respect I demand it I'mma take control of this relationship Command it and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me So you better hear me out this much you owe me I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed Paved for all the way this is how I fucking get repaid Look at how I dress, fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath You know what you've done no need to go in depth I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left I'd laugh while you wept Hows it feel now? Yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said But a special place for you in my heart I have kept It's unfortunate but its Too late for the other side Caught in a chase, to life Too late for the other side Caught in a chase, to life I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh 'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half 'Til I snap, don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap I cannot moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you? Jealous when I spend time with the girls Why I'm married to you still, man, I don't know But tonight I'm serving you with papers, I'm divorcing you Go marry someone else and make 'em famous And take away there freedom like you did to me Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat I'm moving on forget you 'oh Now I'm special, ha, I felt special when I was with you All I ever felt was this, helplessness Imprisoned by a selfish bitch, chew me up and spit me out I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em My friends keep asking why I can't just walk away I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama I'm drawn in, so I guess, I'mma mess, cursed and blessed But this time I'mma, ain't changing my mind I'm climbing out this abyss You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you You left me off your list Fuck you hip hop, I'm leaving you My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just Too late for the other side Caught in a chase, to life Too late for the other side Caught in a change, to life Too late Caught in a chase, to life

I said, "I don't have any answers."

We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any f**in' ability To even stick to a subject, it's k**in' me The inability to pin humility Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of f**in' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em!

The same cat That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that But I think it's inevitable They know what button to press or what lever to pull They give me the snap though And if I'm payin' attention I'm probably makin' it bigger But you've been takin' the dicks in the f**in' back, ho On the brink in a minute, got me thinkin' of finishin' Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits I'm asleep at the wheel again As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent Of another beat I'ma k** again 'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin It better be at least to milligram And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again Levels to this sh**, I got an elevator You could never say to me I'm not a f**in' record breaker I sound like a broken record every time I break a record Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator Motherf**er know I got a right to be this way I got spite inside my DNA But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy It's the moment y'all been waitin' for Like California wishin' rain would pour And that drought y'all have been prayin' for My downfall from the Mile to the Southpaws Still the same Marshall, that outlaw That they say is a writer might've fell off But back on that bull like the cowboys So y'all gotta move , y'all gotta move , y'all gotta move Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

II Seems like, the average lifespan of a white man Is more than twice that of a black lifespanner Wonder if sometimes it has a fight scanner I feel like checking out on life, can't escape my circumstance I'd rather hear them say "Die Nword" than Die Antwoord Ninja, now it's better to describe banter But that's life Strapped, 'cause we're strapped financially And can't find answers We're applying for McDonald's It seems like the only franchise that'll hire, so how can we have higher standards As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter We fight back with violence But acts like that are Black eyes on the movement Which makes wack lives madder At cops and cops madder And that's why it's at a stalemate Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops I wonder if we hire more, black cops, the crap stops The block is our backyard offices Not the crook spot Call the attack dogs off of us, man You always act pissed off at us a traffic stop And bad cops fuck it up for good cops And man, stop, sending white cops, into black neighborhoods 'Cause they ain't acclimated to 'em Like that's the way to do it Who's seen some videos of rappers waving guns And no nobody black so they act afraid of us And that's racism Fear to the black face gives them A subconscious racist Wait, why is there black neighborhoods? 'Cause America segregated us Designated us, to an area Separated us Sectioneight'd us When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us And education sucks, every days another Freddie Grey for us, a levy breaks or fuzz Why is it, they treat us like dryer lint? We just want a safe environment for our kids, but can't escape The sirens Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies In The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in The lowest classes, its like a razor wire fence And we're trapped in, these racial biases That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise Every time we see a devil's face Lions, tigers and bears oh my! More like billy clubs and Gats And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause We're black "But you kill each other, facts you peel each Others caps, for silly stuff like hats" Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse While people with nothing to lose shoot each other for shoes Fuck your republican views Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck is the boots? And streets act as a narrator Don't gotta read comics Or be that into characters, just to see that just to be black, you better be strapped, with a derringer or be "capped in America" like Steve Rogers 'Cause no one overseas, these cops, and Always see some B charges We see them beat Rodney King and got off So we don't need all your crooked police peace offerings Just keep marching, til' we reach congress But they gonna say you're tying to take an irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag But someone has to be the sacrificial lamb So they call it a Kapernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem We raised it, you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield Home of the bravest still, racist spills So the whole nation feels like a plantation field In a country that claims that it was foundation on based on united states ideals That had its Natives killed Got you singing the Star Spangled Banner to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build

Eminem|the way i am|2000|Whatever, Dre, just let it run Aiyyo, turn the beat up a little bit Aiyyo, this song is for anyone, fuck it Just shut up and listen, aiyyo I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve All this tension dispensin' these sentences Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off of this chest And I rest again peacefully But at least have the decency in you To leave me alone when you freaks see me out In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter To not come and speak to me I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick If you tempt me, my tank is on empty No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm liftin' you feet in the air I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you Go, call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe I'm tired of all you I don't mean to be mean But that's all I can be is just me And I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't then why would I say I am?

And look where it's at Middle America, now, it's a tragedy Now, it's so sad to see, an upper class city Havin' this happenin' Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned And I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news everyday I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news everyday I am I don't know it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And dropped from my label and stop with the fables I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is" And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations And I just do not got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk With an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin' The same fuckin' questions What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in? The why, the who what when, the where and the how 'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out 'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit And I'm thankful for every fan that I get But I can't take a shit in the bathroom Without someone standin' by it No, I won't sign your autograph You can call me an asshole I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't then why would I say I am?

Eminem|walk on water|2017|I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes Why, are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set? My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as Soon as I grab, squeeze I lose my grip like the flying trapeze Into the dark, I plummet Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark's high Butterflies rip apart my stomach Knowing that no matter what bars I come with You're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis I feel the ice cracking, because I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes It's the curse of the standard That the first of the Mathers disc set Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark Till I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart Like "This shit is garbage" God's given me all this Still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me like as a god, this is retarded If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive And I try to not listen to nonsense But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence, mission accomplished I'm not Godsent Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so... I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes 'Cause I'm only human, just like you Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest A flawed human, I guess But I'm doing my best to not ruin your ex Pectations and meet 'em, but first, the "Speedom" verse Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom? There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun Am I lucky to be around this long? Begs the question, though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground And all that's left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And it's time to wash out the blonde Sales decline, the curtains drawn They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind And everyone who has doubt, remind Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine 'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine? But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause... I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes 'Cause I'm only human, just like you Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh If I walked on water, I would drown 'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike So me and you are not alike Bitch, I wrote "Stan"
Eminem|stan|2000|My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?

It's like Adrenaline The pain is such a sudden rush for me See everything you say is real And I respect you 'cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'Cause I talk about you But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like? For people like us growing up You've gotta call me man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose Sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I? Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad It's not so bad Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months and still no word I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sending you I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now I'm doing on the freeway Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka Ya dare me to drive? You know this song by Phil Collins 'From the air in the night' About that guy who could have saved That other guy from drowning? But didn't, then Phil saw it all Then at his show he found him That's kinda how this is You could have rescued me from drowning Now it's too late I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all your pictures off the wall I loved you Slim, we could have been together Think about it, you ruined it now I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep And you scream about it I hope your conscious eats at you And you can't breathe without me See Slim, "Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk" Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up See I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more And then she'll die too Well gotta go I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit! I forgot! How am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I? Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad It's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner But I've just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now How far along is she? Look I'm really flattered You would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother I wrote it on your starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show I must have missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally Just to diss you And what's this shit you said about You like to cut your wrist too? I say that shit just clownin' dawg C'mon, how fucked up is you? You got some issues Stan I think you need some counselin'' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls When you get down some And what's this shit about us Meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us To meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend Need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you'd relax a little I'm glad I inspire you But Stan, why are you so mad? Try to understand That I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news A couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk And she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape But it didn't say who it was to?

Eminem|phenomenal|2015|I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phenomenal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em When the going got rough Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy Who the fuck taught you how to persevere? There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go Into waters where nobody else has gone before Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am... I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phenomenal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Let me selfempower you When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel Convert it to gunpowder too Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage Never take back what you say If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match Ready to scrap asap Take your fists and just ball it Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at And set it on 'em like a placemat And I want you to say that I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phenomenal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal Step into the unknown and find yourself You're floating freely, no emotion Got a fuckin' mouth with no shutoff valve Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground Cause I worked my butt off now It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about Cause I stuck it out Like a motherfucking tongue thats how, I responded when I got shoved around You're gonna have nonbelievers But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how Get it how you live But are you prepared to give more than you get? And put in twice what you get back from this shit Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give Rap is my shiv But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt Ready to face any challenge, waitin' Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation Look what I have built, reputation is validation The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact That is the only way you'll ever be able to say Your legend is makin' an allegation I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath Managed to prove who the best man is Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phenomenal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Racking up hits to stacking them crates up. I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm! And we was happening and rap entertainment, Me and shady for us competition, faggot there ain't none! Speak of the devil, it's the attack of the rain man, Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron. Soon as the blades spun vrun they run away from, Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from!

Naked wives and Vicodin, Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy I could spin. Vinvin! F*ck the handle! I fly off the hinge! Let the boy off the bench coach and throw it to him. There he goes in his trench coat and them clothes again, Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin.

There's a local band playing at the seaside pavillion And I've got just enough cash to get us in And as we are dancing, Mary's wrapping her arms around me And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin. In the midst of the music I tell her I love her And we both laugh, ;cause we know it isn't true Ah, but Mary, there's a summer drawing to an end tonight And there's so much that I long to do to you. But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland So tonight I hope that I will do just fine And I don't see how you could ever be Anything but mine. And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland So tonight I hope that I will do just fine And I don't see how you could ever be Anything but mine. Mary, I don't see how you could ever be Anything but mine. And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland So tonight I hope that I will do just fine And I don't see how you could ever be Anything but mine...

I can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I'm confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.

Chicago|if she would have been faithful |1987|I was thinking about her visiting the past Reconstructing details with old photographs I was studying the faces with an objective point of view Suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me At the time you couldn't tell me that one day I'd be glad That something that I thought was love, was misinterpreted She had another lover, she emphatically denied But they were doing me a favor, a blessing in disguise If she would have been faithful If she could have been true Then I would've been cheated I would never know real love I would've missed out on you I watch you sleeping, your body touching me There's no doubt about it, this is where I want to be You know it's so ironic I had to lose to win I want to thank her If she would have been faithful If she could have been true Then I would've been cheated I would never know real love I would've missed out on you It's a paradox full of contradiction How I got from there to here It defies a logical explanation If she would have been faithful If she could have been true Then I would've been cheated I would never know real love I would've missed out on you If she would have been faithful If she could have been true Then I would've been cheated I would never know real love I would've missed out on you If she would have been faithful If she would have been faithful If she would have been faithful If she would have been faithful
Chicago|youre not alone|1989| I see you there, a silhouette in the moonlight;Looks like you've given up on love.You used to be the face in the spotlight;Now lonliness fits you like a glove.You walk around in your cloak of darkness,Too blind to see the light.Your wings are broken, now your spirit can't take flight.You're not alone, you're not alone,While your heart's still young and free.You're not alone, pick up the phoneAnd talk to me; baby, you will seeYou're not alone.Pools of sorrow and tears of joy;There's a brokenup girl for every brokendown boy.But you don't wanna hear it,You like the rhythm of the blues;Wanna be a sad story on the latenight news.I don't mean to burst your bubble,But the world's got troubles worse than you.And everybody else out here gets lonely too.You're not alone, you're not alone,I've been waiting patiently.No, you're not alone, pick up the phoneAnd talk to me, baby, you will see...Although your heart is in pieces,You can't find a reason to try.You're not alone, while I'm still standing by.You're not alone, you're not alone,While your heart's still young and free.You're not alone, pick up the phoneAnd talk to me; baby, you will seeYou're not alone.

Elton John|sad songs|1984|Sad Songs Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain And ironing out the rough spots Is the hardest part when memories remain And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio `Cause from the lips of some old singer We can share the troubles we already know Turn them on, turn them on Turn on those sad songs When all hope is gone Why don't you tune in and turn them on They reach into your room Just feel their gentle touch When all hope is gone Sad songs say so much If someone else is suffering enough to write it down When every single word makes sense Then it's easier to have those songs around The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you and it feels so good to hurt so bad And suffer just enough to sing the blues Sad songs, they say Sad songs, they say Sad songs, they say Sad songs, they say so much

Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for? Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk, though But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for? Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this? It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print You on some choosin'side shit, I'm on some unified shit It's bigger than your selfish agenda If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas, then shit... Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people Actually wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal You gotta see the vantage point of the people What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil See that's the problem with this damn nation All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain't made it off the plantation Fuck who you choose as your political party You representin' dudes just seem crude and coldhearted With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position Don't you feel an obligation to them? I feel an obligation to show people new ideas And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here Make America Great Again had a negative reception I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction Added empathy, care and love and affection And y'all simply questionin' my methods What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?

Huh? 'Cause it's cultural? Or how about I'ma shoot you, or fuck your bitch? Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich You'll deal with God for the lack of respect Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit? Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget And all that free thought shit, find a better defense But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that Fuck it Alright T.I.P., we could be rappin' about this all day, man, why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?

Elvis Presley|rockahula baby|1961| The way she moves her hips to her fingertips I feel I'm heaven bound And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say She really move the grass around Rockahula baby Rockahula baby Got a hula lulu from Honolulu That rockahula baby of mine Although I love to kiss my little hula miss I never get the chance I wanna hold her tight all through the night But all she wants to do is dance I bet that she could teach the palms along the beach To sway when breezes blow And birds up in the sky could learn to fly By watchin' how my baby can go 
Elvis Presley|if i can dream|1969|There must be lights burning brighter somewhere Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue If I can dream of a better land Where all my brothers walk hand in hand Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why can't my dream come true? Oh, why? There must be peace and understanding sometime Strong winds of promise that will blow away The doubt and fear If I can dream of a warmer sun Where hope keeps shining on everyone Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why won't that sun appear?
